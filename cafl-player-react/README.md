# Simple Frequency Player
Based on information gathered by Rife and others, here's a small browser-based frequency player.

The frequency database is thanks to http://www.electroherbalism.com/Bioelectronics/FrequenciesandAnecdotes/CAFL.htm.

## TODOs

* Actually integrate the logic from `cafl-player3` for playback logic
* Incorporate https://github.com/googlecreativelab/chrome-music-lab/tree/master/spectrogram/src (see https://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com/Spectrogram/)
* Incorporate a loading component something like:
  * https://github.com/fakiolinho/react-loading
  * https://github.com/KyleAMathews/react-spinkit
  * https://medium.com/@chrisburgin95/using-react-and-styled-components-to-make-a-simple-loading-animation-df1330c652cb
